# Dungeon Game in C
This game is an attempt to learn about structuring (slightly) larger C programs through experience.
My University courses use C to teach algorithms, which despite being interesting, don't offer a lot of exposure to the problems I hope to learn about here.

This code, being personal study, is not represenative of how I would actually solve problems.

## Libraries/Explanation
Uses the excellent [Kinc](https://github.com/Kode/Kinc) to provide cross-platform media capabilities, including hardware accelerated graphics. Built using Kinc's JS based build tool, and your C++ compiler.
